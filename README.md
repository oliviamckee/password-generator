# Password Generator Starter Code
I created this application to generate a random secure password based on the user's selected criteria: length and type of characters. On startup, the app will ask the user to select a password length between 8 adn 128 characters. The app will then ask the user if they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and special characters. Once the user has answered all questions, the random secure password is generated.
